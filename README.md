# Binout
Matlab functions to work with LS-DYNA `binout` files. The function `get_binout_data()` (called the binout reader) is the one that reads the binout file.
The function `get_d3plot_d3thdt_control_data()` is a helper function that is called (internally) from within the binout reader function.
The function `struct2graph()` is entirely standalone function that takes a MATALB (nested) structure (`struct`) and produce figures displaying the heiraracy map (graph), as a convenient means of seeing visually what fields are available in the structure.

## binout reader
### what is `binout`?
Binout is a binary file generated by LS-DYNA after running LS-DYNA model. It contains various results databases, such as "matsum" (material summary and energy data), "nodout" (node output data, like displacements, velocities, etc), "elout" (element output data, like stresses, stress-resultants, strains, etc), and so on. A binout gets written if the input model includes one or more of `*databases_<option>', where `<option> can be `matsum`, `nodout`, etc, and these include `BINARY` set to 2, indicating that results are requested in binary format in spite of "ASCII" format. The binout file size is thus much smaller than the corresponding ASCII counterparts. LS-DYNA lumps all databases (i.e. "matsum", "nodout", etc) into one single `binout` file.

### Usage
The formal syntax is 
```
[binin] = get_binout_data(binout_filename)
```
#### inputs:
`binout_filename` = [Required] (absoulte or relative) path to the root binary `binout` file. Type: [`char`|`string`].
#### outputs:
`binin` = structure containing all the data in the `binout` file(s). Type: MATLAB scalar structure [`struct`]. This is a highly nested structure. Use the "." (dot) indexing method in MATLAB to traverse the `binin` structure to arrive at a data of interest. 
The returned `binin` structure will have `n` root fields, where (`n-1`) is the number of databases contained in the `binout` file(s), such as "matsum", "nodout", etc. The last `n`<sup>th</sup> field (when available) is called "control".
Every root field is itself a scaler structure. Some kinds of root structures will have intermediate sub-structures (as in the `binout` file). At some level, there will be idnentically two structures: "metadata" and "data". For example, the "binin.matsum" structure will have the fields "metadata" and "data" as the immediate fields. On the other hand, the "binin.elout" structure will contain itermediate fields like "shell". In this case, the "metadata" and "data" structures are fields of "binin.elout.shell".
The "data" structure has fields whose names are borrowed directly from the original `binout` file. The values associated with these fields are the actual data of interest. The naming of the fields are practically self-explainatory. Example fields under "binin.matsum.data" are "kinetic_energy", "time", etc.   
The "metadata" structure is similar to the "data" (described above), and it contains mostly meta data and few important data like the id's of parts, nodes, etc. The id's are usually stored in the "ids" field of the "metadata" structure.
The root field "control" under the `binin` structure contains supplementary control data retrieved from the root `d3plot` file, which is provided through (internally) calling the `get_d3plot_d3thdt_control_data()` helper function. Note that this will be done if there is a root `d3plot` available in the same folder as the `binout` file passed to the binout reader function. 
#### optional
If needed, one can use the standalone function `struct2graph()` to visually display the heiraracy map of the `binin` structure returned by the binout reader function. The former function accepts a scalar (nested) MATLAB structure as the first input argument, and produces figures and return their handles. If this is your first time, provide the second input argument as "All" so that every root sub-structure under the `binin` gets displayed in a seperate figure, which lists all the terminal fields under "data" and "metadata".
